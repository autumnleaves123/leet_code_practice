We determined that biconditional statement (c) was accurate when integer division was used and resulted in 3 cases, most notably the boundary condition case where rev_x == max_rev_x and the last digit of x to be added to rev_x matters because that digit could cause rev_x to be greater than INT_MAX\n",
